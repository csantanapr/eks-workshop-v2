In Kubernetes, workflows are a way to orchestrate containerized tasks in a coordinated sequence. These workflows are particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines, batch processing, and data science tasks. One popular tool for managing workflows in a Kubernetes environment is [Argo Workflows](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows). Argo Workflows is an open-source, container-native workflow engine for orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. It allows you to define complex workflows using simple YAML configuration files, and it integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes resources. With Argo, you can create reusable, parameterized workflow templates, and even manage complex dependencies between tasks.
